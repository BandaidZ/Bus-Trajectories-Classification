## Data Mining Course - Time Series and Spatial Data Classification (Bus trajectories)
This project uses the DTW and LCSS algorithms with the help of the KNN classifier to classify bus trajectories.

To install all the dependencies on your virtual environment, run:
* pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the data visualization (Convert random trajectories to images) script and the DTW and LCSS algorithms with the KNN classifier with python 3, run:
* python main.py
